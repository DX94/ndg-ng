DEVELOPER PRACTICES

 * Our Documentation style is restructuredtext (RST)

APPLICATION LAYOUT
==================

A) app/ contains the application's core, split between models, controllers and views directories. It can contain other Java packages as well. This is the directory where .java source files live.

B) conf/ contains all the configuration files for the application, especially the main application.conf file, the routes definition files and the messages files used for i internationalization.

C) lib/ contains all optional Java libraries packaged as standard .jar files.

D) public/ optimized assets which represent the front end of the site. It includes JavaScript files, stylesheets and images directories.

F) assets/ source files (html, css, javascript). The ant build file in assets/build optimizes these files and then places them in the assets/public directory. This files in this folder can then be copied to the public/ folder above

E) test/ contains all the application tests. Tests are either written either as Java JUnit tests or as Selenium tests
