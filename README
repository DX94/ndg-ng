GETTING STARTED
================================

    We use Ubuntu 11.10
    First, install mysql server if needed (if its not already installed):
    $ sudo apt-get install mysql-server
    Then, login to mysql as a root:
    mysql -u root -p
    This will ask you for the root password for mysql.
    In mysql the ndg local user should be created with the same password and then the database 'ndg2' should be created
    and the user granted access to it:
    mysql> create user 'ndg'@'localhost' identified by 'ndg';
    mysql> create database ndg2;
    mysql> grant all privileges on ndg2.* to ndg@localhost;
    Make sure java is installed (enter java -version to check)
    wget -c http://downloads.typesafe.com/play/1.2.5.2/play-1.2.5.2.zip and extract the archive to a location where you have both read and write access
    Add the play script to your PATH
    export PATH=$PATH:/relativePath/to/play
    (make sure that the play script is executable (otherwise do a chmod a+x play))
    git clone https://github.com/nokiadatagathering/ndg-ng.git
    cd assets/build/
    (install necessary tools (sudo apt-get install optipng libjpeg-progs) to optimize assets.This is not needed on Windows machines. ant needs to be version 1.8.2 so you may need to do
                  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:eclipse-team/debian-package
                  sudo apt-get update
                  sudo apt-get install ant
    )
    ant -f build_dev.xml (or just 'ant build' if you are going to production)  
    cd ../..
    cd conf
    vim application.conf - and change 
                                http.address=<your_IP_address>
                           and Mail configuration if you want to use the registration
    vim msm-settings.properties - and change
                                  client.ota=http\://<your_IP_address>/\:9000/ndg-ota/client/ndg.jad
                                  urlServer=http\://<your_IP_address>\:9000
    play run
    http://<your_IP_address>:9000/

    It is advisable to change the default password of the admin user after install. To do this use a service like http://www.md5hashgenerator.com/ with the string admin:NDG:<new password> and then with the resulting md5 hash run

    mysql> update ndg_user set password="<new hash>" where username="admin";


DEVELOPER PRACTICES
================================


We are using Git as the Source Control Manager (SCM)

Our Documentation style is Markdown


APPLICATION LAYOUT
================================


1. app/ contains the application's core, split between models, controllers and views directories. It can contain other Java packages as well. This is the directory where .java source files live.

2. conf/ contains all the configuration files for the application, especially the main application.conf file, the routes definition files and the messages files used for internationalization.

3. lib/ contains all optional Java libraries packaged as standard .jar files.

4. public/ optimized assets which represent the front end of the site. It includes JavaScript files, stylesheets and images directories.

5. assets/ source files (html, css, javascript). The ant build file in assets/build optimizes these files and then places them in the assets/public directory. The folder does not need to be deployed when going live.

6. test/ contains all the application tests. Tests are either written either as Java JUnit tests or as Selenium tests
