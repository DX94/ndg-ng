DEVELOPER PRACTICES

We are using Git as the Source Control Manager (SCM)

Our Documentation style is Markdown


APPLICATION LAYOUT
================================


1. app/ contains the application's core, split between models, controllers and views directories. It can contain other Java packages as well. This is the directory where .java source files live.

2. conf/ contains all the configuration files for the application, especially the main application.conf file, the routes definition files and the messages files used for internationalization.

3. lib/ contains all optional Java libraries packaged as standard .jar files.

4. public/ optimized assets which represent the front end of the site. It includes JavaScript files, stylesheets and images directories.

5. assets/ source files (html, css, javascript). The ant build file in assets/build optimizes these files and then places them in the assets/public directory. The files in this folder can then be copied to the public/ folder above

6. test/ contains all the application tests. Tests are either written either as Java JUnit tests or as Selenium tests
